        <h2 class="text-center fw-bold fs-3 text-uppercase mb-3">Brazil</h2>
        <p class="fw-semibold text-center lh-base"> Arabica dominates both Brazil and the world as a whole with about 85% of the production; robusta
            accounts for the remaining 30%. In Brazil, arabica production is located in the main coffee-growing
            cluster of states led by Rio where arabica is
            produced almost exclusively. Robusta is primarily grown in the northwestern much smaller state
            of Espirito Santo where about 80% of the coffee is robusta.

        <h2 class="text-center fw-bold fs-3 text-uppercase mb-3">Colombia</h2>
        <p  class="fw-semibold text-center lh-base"> Colombia has a reputation as producing mild, well balanced coffee beans.Colombia's average
            annual coffee production of 11.5 million bags is the third total highest in the world, after Brazil and
            Vietnam; though highest in terms of the arabica
            bean. The beans are exported to United States, Germany, France, Japan, and Italy. Most coffee is
            grown in the Colombian coffee growing axis region.

        <h2 class="text-center fw-bold fs-3 text-uppercase mb-3">India</h2>
        <p class="fw-semibold text-center lh-base"> Indian coffee, grown mostly in southern India under monsoon rainfall conditions, is also termed as
            Indian monsooned coffee". Its flavor is defined as: "At its best similar to the flavor characteristics
            of
            Pacific coffees, but at its worst bland and uninspiring. The two well known species of coffee grown are
            the Arabica and Robusta. Probably the most commonly planted Arabica in India and Southeast Asia is
            S.795.

        <p class="fw-semibold text-center lh-base"> Ethiopian beans can be divided into 3 categories: Longberry, Shortberry, and Mocha. Longberry
            varieties consist of the largest beans and are often considered of the highest quality in both value and
            flavor. Shortberry varieties are smaller. The Mocha variety is a highly prized commodity. Mocha
            Harars are known for their peaberry beans that often have complex chocolate, spice and citrus notes.
